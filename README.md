# Contactless-Distance-Measurement-System

In this project we have developed a contactless
distance measurement system which works on 
ultrasonic waves.
    By using the system we can measure distance
from system to the obstacle without any physical
contact with accuracy of 3 mm. The range upto 
which system detects accurate distance is 2 cm
to 400 cm.

Working- 
1) First of all the ultrasonic sound is
   radiated by the ultrasonic sensor. 
2) After that the ultrasonic waves reflects
   back from obstacle and are detected by the 
   ultrasonic sensor itself.
3) Then the time of reflection is measured and
   using that distance is calculated.
4) Then that distance is displayed on lcd display
